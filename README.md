# LPX

LPX is a fire enabled  DGVM in the LPJ suite of models. It is a development of LPJ-SPITFIRE (Thonicke et al., 2010), with some improvement in the fire component, documented in Prentice et al (2011). 

The configuration here (in lpj.cfg) is from Sato et al. 2021. LPX  was also used to simulate current (Murray et al., 2012) & future  (Murray et al., 2013) global hydrological cycles; carbon stores at the last ice age (Ciais et al., 2012); and in the development of a DGVM benchmarking system (Kelley et al., 2013).
